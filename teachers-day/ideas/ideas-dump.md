1st Mod PE lesson

* "A lot of you are wearing black masks. Y'all look like ninjas. Ninja, Ninja, Ninja, Ninja..." (looks at Christian) "Oops sorry, cannibal" (lol ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚) If this is too personal i'll remove it

English lesson on public speaking (I think)

* "There was this one boy, he went to an interview for a scholarship, and he told the interviewers : 'Umm, I actually think that the other people are better...' and I was like, "Seriously?! You come here to prove you are better, not say that they are better!!!"

PE lesson

* "Now count in your sexy voice..." (y'all shld remember this)
