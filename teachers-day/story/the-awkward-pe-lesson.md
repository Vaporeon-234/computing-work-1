# The awkward (really awkward) PE lesson

Never have I expected this to happen during pe lesson lol 🤣🤣

It was a sunny day (so *cliche*). The class was having Chinese lesson. When the bell rang, suddnely, Regina (you can ask me not to use ur name) asked Mdm Sim “现在是PE了！” The whole class started laughing and Mdm Sim asked, "Are you scared of Ms Lee?" We didn't reply but I bet that we were all thinking "of course lol she is assisstant year head"

We quickly changed **ahem ahem** quickly and then rushed **ahem ahem** to the parade square.

To our surprise, we did not see Ms Lee waiting for us there. Instead, she lead us to the open space outside the library.
