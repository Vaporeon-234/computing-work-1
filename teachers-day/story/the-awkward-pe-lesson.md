# The awkward (really awkward) PE lesson

Never have I expected this to happen during pe lesson lol 🤣🤣

It was a sunny day (so *cliche*). The class was having Chinese lesson. When the bell rang, suddnely, Regina (you can ask me not to use ur name) asked Mdm Sim “现在是PE了！” The whole class started laughing and Mdm Sim asked, "Are you scared of Ms Lee?" We didn't reply but I bet that we were all thinking "of course lol she is assisstant year head"

We quickly changed **ahem ahem** quickly and then rushed **ahem ahem** to the parade square.

To our surprise, we did not see Ms Lee waiting for us there. Instead, she lead us to the open space outside the library. She asked us to sit in register number order and then told us "We will be doing some simple stretching here today!"

*(Me being like umm with all the people looking at us? Ok...?)*

And we started our stretching. Ms Lee told us to count to 10 and asked us to count in other languages (Like Japanese and Chinese etc.). After a while, Ms Lee suddenly said something that made us really freaked out (or just made things really awkward).

"Now, let me count in my cute voice!!" Ms Lee said.
